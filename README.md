# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. This project involves the use of regression techniques to tackle the problem and aims to provide insights into the factors that influence movie ratings.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the ratings given to movies by users or critics. By exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques, this project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting movie ratings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features for each movie:

- **MovieID**: Unique identifier for each movie
- **Title**: Title of the movie
- **Genre**: Genre of the movie
- **Director**: Director of the movie
- **Actors**: Main actors in the movie
- **Year**: Release year of the movie
- **Runtime**: Runtime of the movie (in minutes)
- **Rating**: The rating given to the movie (target variable)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the movie dataset files (`movies.csv`).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- **models/**: Serialized models and related files.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-rating-prediction.git
   cd movie-rating-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the data**:
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the dataset and understand the preprocessing steps.

4. **Train the model**:
   Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
   ```sh
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the model**:
   Evaluate the trained model using a validation dataset and check the results:
   ```sh
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```
