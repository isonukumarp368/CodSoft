## Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project in the field of data science and machine learning, utilizing the well-known Titanic dataset.

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information. By analyzing these features, we aim to uncover insights and build a model that can accurately predict survival outcomes.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features for each passenger:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources to build a model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks in the field of machine learning.

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of Iris flowers and accurately classify them into their respective species. By utilizing the Iris dataset, we will explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building techniques to develop an effective classification model.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features for each flower:

- **SepalLengthCm**: Sepal length in centimeters
- **SepalWidthCm**: Sepal width in centimeters
- **PetalLengthCm**: Petal length in centimeters
- **PetalWidthCm**: Petal width in centimeters
- **Species**: Species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files (`iris.csv` for Iris Flower Classification, `train.csv` and `test.csv` for Titanic Survival Prediction).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- **models/**: Serialized models and related files.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.
