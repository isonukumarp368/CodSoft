# Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources to build a model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks in the field of machine learning.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of Iris flowers and accurately classify them into their respective species. By utilizing the Iris dataset, we will explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building techniques to develop an effective classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features for each flower:

- **SepalLengthCm**: Sepal length in centimeters
- **SepalWidthCm**: Sepal width in centimeters
- **PetalLengthCm**: Petal length in centimeters
- **PetalWidthCm**: Petal width in centimeters
- **Species**: Species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the Iris dataset file (`iris.csv`).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- **models/**: Serialized models and related files.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the data**:
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the dataset and understand the preprocessing steps.

4. **Train the model**:
   Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
   ```sh
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the model**:
   Evaluate the trained model using a validation dataset and check the results:
   ```sh
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```
