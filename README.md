# Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project in the field of data science and machine learning, utilizing the well-known Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information. By analyzing these features, we aim to uncover insights and build a model that can accurately predict survival outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features for each passenger:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the Titanic dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- **models/**: Serialized models and related files.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the data**:
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the dataset and understand the preprocessing steps.

4. **Train the model**:
   Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
   ```sh
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the model**:
   Evaluate the trained model using the test dataset and check the results:
   ```sh
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```
